DISCRIPTION OF THE WEBSITE:

The website has been deliberately developed to meet accessibility requirements, promoting an inclusive digital environment for all users. After studying the source code, it is clear that semantic HTML components have been meticulously incorporated. These aspects contribute to a logical structure that is independent of style and location, improving the usability and navigability of the site for those who use assistive technology.

The inclusion of accessible alt attributes for images and symbols throughout the website has been a primary emphasis area. This deliberate practise guarantees that users using assistive technology or experiencing visual impairments may completely comprehend the transmitted information of these visual components, resulting in a more holistic user experience.

Furthermore, the header attributes have been organised sequentially, a deliberate move aimed at boosting reading and content understanding for all users. This strategic layout adheres to accessibility rules, resulting in a fluid browsing experience for those with varying needs.

Finally, the website's title element stands out for its succinct and descriptive character. It successfully captures the core of the online page, helping to a better user experience and ease of navigation, especially for people who use screen readers or navigate among browser tabs.

The diligent application of semantic HTML components, a logical structure, the inclusion of accessible features, sequential heading order, and informative titles all contribute to our dedication to satisfying accessibility requirements. These initiatives are intended to establish an inclusive and inviting digital environment for all visitors to our website.

MAIN ISSUES OF STUGGLE DURING THE PROJECT:
One of the difficulties I've had is aligning the project with semantic HTML components rather than standard div> elements. Moving away from the omnipresent div> structure and towards semantic components has been an important feature of our work.

Semantic HTML elements convey material in a more meaningful and structured manner, offering clarity and context to assistive technology and search engines. However, transitioning from generic div> tags to semantic components can be difficult, necessitating careful analysis of the content's purpose and relationships.

It entails determining appropriate semantic components such as header>, nav>, main>, article>, section>, aside>, and footer> that appropriately reflect the various portions of the webpage. Each element has a distinct meaning that defines its role within the overall page layout.

The shift to semantic HTML components is a process that involves careful preparation, implementation, and a thorough knowledge of how these elements contribute to improved accessibility and better content representation on our website.
